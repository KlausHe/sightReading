 This is a little project that generates random melodies. The pitches and notelength are created randomly within some boundaries you can set in the inputs on the right/below. 
 There are 4 levels of difficulty to choose from. 
Additionally there will be some exercises for you to choose from to practise particular rythms or styles.
